\newglossaryentry{survivalanalysis}{
  name={survival analysis},
  description={A \index{survival analysis} survival analysis is a branch of statistics and \gls{ml} that deals with time-to-event \gls{data}, where the goal is to estimate the time until an event of interest (e.g., failure, death, or relapse) occurs \cite{Wang2019_2025}. It accounts for censored observations and focuses on estimating survival functions, hazard rates, and \gls{risk} scores \cite{Kleinbaum1998} . \\

\newglossaryentry{rsf} 
{name={random survival forest},
  description={A\index{random survival forest} random survival forest (RSF) \cite{Ishwaran2008} is an ensemble of \glspl{decisiontree} designed for time-to-event (survival) \gls{data}. 
    Each tree is grown on a \gls{bootstrap} sample of the original \gls{dataset} with random \gls{feature} selection at splits, using survival-specific split criteria (e.g., log-rank). 
    The forest aggregates per-tree survival estimates to produce an overall survival function and risk scores, and naturally handles right-censoring.
    RSF extends the principles of \gls{randomforest} to survival settings and has been shown to perform well in high-dimensional biomedical and real-world \glspl{dataset}
    \cite{Wang2019,Salerno2023}.

\newglossaryentry{hazardfunction}
{name={hazard function},
  description={A\index{hazard function} hazard function, also known as the hazard rate or failure rate, 
    represents the immediate risk of an event occurring at a specific time, given that the subject has survived up to that time. 
    It is a key quantity in \gls{survivalanalysis} and forms the basis for \glspl{model} such as the \gls{coxph}.

\newglossaryentry{indicator}{
  name={indicator}, plural={indicators}, 
  description={An \index{indicator} indicator is a binary variable that takes values $0$ or $1$ to represent whether a specific condition or event has occurred. In \gls{survivalanalysis}, an indicator commonly denotes whether the event of interest was observed ($1$) or censored ($0$), and is used together with the observed time to define \glspl{survivaloutcome} and construct likelihood-based estimators such as the \gls{coxph} \cite{Cox1972,Kleinbaum2012}.

\newglossaryentry{covariate}{
  name={covariate}, plural={covariates}, 
  description={A \index{covariate} covariate is an observed variable associated with an individual or unit that is used as an \gls{inputvec} to a statistical or \gls{ml} \gls{model} to explain or predict an \gls{survivaloutcome} of interest. In \gls{survivalanalysis}, covariates represent subject-specific characteristics (e.g., age, biomarkers, treatment indicators) that influence the \gls{hazardfunction} or survival function, typically through a \gls{regression} structure such as the \gls{coxph} \gls{model}. Covariates may be time-invariant or time-varying and are assumed to affect the risk of event occurrence without themselves being the primary \gls{survivaloutcome} \cite{Cox1972,Kleinbaum2012}.

\newglossaryentry{survivaloutcome}{
  name={survival outcome}, plural={survivaloutcomes},
  description={A \index{survival outcome} survival outcome refers to the observed time-to-event information used as the \gls{target} variable in \gls{survivalanalysis}, typically represented by a pair consisting of an event time and an event indicator. The event time denotes the duration from a defined origin (e.g., diagnosis or treatment initiation) to the occurrence of an event of interest, while the indicator specifies whether the event was observed or the observation was censored. survival outcome form the basis for estimating survival functions, hazard rates, and risk scores in \glspl{model} such as the \gls{coxph} \gls{model} \cite{Cox1972,Kleinbaum2012}.

{name={Cox Proportional Hazards},
  description={A\index{Cox Proportional Hazards} Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) \gls{model} is a semi-\gls{parameter} \gls{model} used in \gls{survivalanalysis} to relate multiple \glspl{covariate} to the hazard rate of an event. 
    It assumes that the \gls{lossfunc} for an individual is the product of a \gls{baseline} hazard and an exponential function of \glspl{covariate}. 
    The \gls{model} estimates relative \gls{risk} without requiring the \gls{baseline} hazard to be specified explicitly.

  description={A\index{Cox Neural Network} Cox Neural Network (CoxNet) is a \gls{deeplearning} extension of the \gls{coxph} \gls{model} that uses  \glspl{ann} to learn complex, non-linear relationships between \glspl{covariate} and survival outcomes, typically represented by event times and censoring indicators. 
  It optimizes the Cox partial likelihood function while allowing for flexible \gls{feature} representations, making it suitable for high- \gls{dimension} or unstructured \gls{data} such as images or text.

\newglossaryentry{baselinehazard}
{name={baseline hazard},
  description={A\index{baseline hazard} \gls{baseline} hazard, denoted \(h_{0}(t)\), represents the underlying 
    \gls{hazardfunction} for an individual with \gls{baseline} or reference \glspl{feature} (typically coded as zero) 
    in the \gls{coxph} \gls{model}. It captures how the event risk changes over time independently of \gls{covariate} effects. 
    Although the \gls{coxph} \gls{model} does not specify a parametric form for \(h_{0}(t)\), it can be estimated 
    non-parametrically from the \gls{data} using methods such as the Breslow estimator \cite{Kleinbaum2012}.
