## 🧩 How to Contribute

We warmly welcome contributions from students, researchers, and educators worldwide!  
Follow these steps to propose new entries, translations, or figure improvements.

### **Step 1 — Fork the Repository**
1. Visit the [AaltoDictionaryofML GitHub repository](https://github.com/AaltoDictionaryofML/AaltoDictionaryofML.github.io).  
2. Click **“Fork”** (top-right corner) to create your own copy under your GitHub account.

### **Step 2 — Clone Your Fork**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/AaltoDictionaryofML.github.io.git
cd AaltoDictionaryofML.github.io
```

### **Step 3 — Create a New Branch**
```bash
git checkout -b add-new-term-loss-function
```

### **Step 4 — Understand the Project Structure**

All content is written in LaTeX and structured as follows:

| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **`ADictML_English.tex`** | *Front matter and main LaTeX driver.* Loads macros, bibliography, and includes the main glossary file. Defines title page, TOC, and layout settings. |
| **`ADictML_Glossary_English.tex`** | *Main content file.* Contains all English glossary entries, each created via `\newglossaryentry{...}`. Contributors usually edit this file when adding or revising terms. |
| **`/assets/ml_macros.tex`** | *Macro definitions.* Provides standardized LaTeX commands for common ML notation (e.g. `\lossfunction`, `\dataset`, `\feature`, `\paramvec`, etc.). New entries should reuse these macros for consistency. |
| **`/assets/Literature.bib`** | *Bibliographic database.* Contains BibTeX entries for textbooks, journal articles, and reports cited across entries. Use `\cite{}` commands to reference them. |

Example of a new glossary entry:
```latex
\newglossaryentry{lossfunction}{
  name={Loss function},
  description={A function $\lossfunction(\model(\feature), \label)$ measuring model performance by comparing predictions to true labels. Common examples include the squared error and cross-entropy loss.},
  see=[See also:]{riskminimization}
}
```

Figures created in TikZ can be added under `/figures/` and referenced from entries using standard LaTeX commands.

### **Step 5 — Commit and Push**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add glossary entry: Loss Function"
git push origin add-new-term-loss-function
```

---

### **Step 6 — Open a Pull Request**
1. Go to your fork on GitHub.  
2. Click **“Compare & pull request.”**  
3. Describe your contribution briefly and submit.  
4. The editorial team will review, comment, and merge upon approval.

### 💡 Contribution Tips

- Keep definitions concise (3–6 sentences).  
- Follow notation from `/assets/ml_macros.tex`.  
- Add cross-links via the `see=` field in `\newglossaryentry`.  
- When citing references, use keys from `/assets/Literature.bib`.  
- Discuss major new ideas via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AaltoDictionaryofML/AaltoDictionaryofML.github.io/issues).
