{name={machine learning system (ML system)},
	description={An machine learning (ML) system\index{machine learning system (ML system)} 
		consists of computational devices that can gather and store data, 
		execute algorithms, and exchange information via communication networks. 
		Examples of the exchanged information include data or updates of 
		model parameters. Conceptually, an machine learning (ML) system is distinct from 
		an machine learning (ML) algorithm, i.e., an algorithm specifies 
		the abstract computational procedure (e.g., an optimization method), 
		while the system specifies how this procedure is realized in practice
		\cite{Sipser2013}, \cite{KnuthAlgoBook}, \cite{tanenbaum2006modern}.
		Examples of algorithms executed by devices within an machine learning (ML) system include
		gradient-based methods for solving empirical risk minimization (ERM) problems.

{name={automaton},
	description={An\index{automaton} automaton is a mathematical representation of a computing device 
		whose behavior is described by a set of internal states, a memory 
		structure, and a state-transition rule. Formally, an automaton consists 
		of a state space, a set of admissible memory configurations, 
		and a transition function that specifies how the current state 
		and memory are updated in response to inputs \cite{Sipser2013}. 
		The notion of an automaton is useful for the analysis of algorithms, such 
		as those used in machine learning (ML) methods \cite{Cormen:2022aa}. 
		Collections of interacting automata can be used to study distributed algorithms, 
		where each automaton represents a device that executes local computations and 
		communicates with other devices \cite{ParallelDistrBook}, \cite{LynchDistributedAlgorithms}.

	description={An federated learning (FL) system\index{federated learning system (FL system)} is a 
		distributed machine learning system (ML system) in which multiple computational devices 
		collaborate to train machine learning (ML) models without sharing their raw local data.
		An federated learning (FL) system is characterized by a communication network that specifies 
		which devices can exchange information. Conceptually, an federated learning (FL) system is 
		distinct from an federated learning (FL) algorithm \cite{DistributedSystems}. The system 
		specifies the participating entities, their interconnections, and execution constraints, while the algorithm 
		specifies the update rules for local and global model parameters \cite{LynchDistributedAlgorithms}, \cite{KnuthAlgoBook}.
		Typical information exchanged in an federated learning (FL) system includes 
		model parameters or gradient information, but not raw data.

		In machine learning (ML), cloud computing systems are commonly used to host large datasets

		a dynamical system is commonly described by an iteration of the form 
		${\bf s}^{(t+1)} =\mathcal{F}{\bf s}^{(t)}$, where ${\bf s}^{(t)}$ 
		denotes the state at time $t$ and $\mathcal{F}$ is
