{name={machine learning system (ML system)},
	description={An machine learning (ML) system\index{machine learning system (ML system)} 
		consists of computational devices that can gather and store data, 
		execute algorithms, and exchange information via communication networks. 
		Examples of the exchanged information include data or updates of 
		model parameters. Conceptually, an machine learning (ML) system is distinct from 
		an machine learning (ML) algorithm: an algorithm specifies 
		the abstract computational procedure (e.g., an optimization method), 
		while the system specifies how this procedure is realized in practice
		\cite{sipser2012computation,KnuthAlgoBook,tanenbaum2006modern}.
		Examples of algorithms executed by devices within an machine learning system (ML system) include
		gradient-based methods for solving empirical risk minimization (ERM) problems.

{name={federated learning system (FL system)},
	description={A federated learning (FL) system\index{federated learning system (FL system)} is a 
		distributed machine learning system (ML system) in which multiple computational devices 
		collaborate to train machine learning (ML) models without sharing their raw local data.
		An federated learning (FL) system is characterized by a communication network that specifies 
		which devices can exchange information. Conceptually, an federated learning (FL) system is 
		distinct from an federated learning (FL) algorithm \cite{DistributedSystems}. The system 
		specifies the participating entities, their interconnections, and execution constraints, while the algorithm 
		specifies the update rules for local and global model parameters \cite{KnuthAlgoBook,LynchDistributedAlgorithms}.
		Typical information exchanged in an federated learning (FL) system includes 
		model parameters or gradient information, but not raw data.
