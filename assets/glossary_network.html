A key conceptual property of a random experiment is that it can be repeated under identical conditions. Strictly speaking, repeating a random experiment a given number of times defines a new random experiment. The outcomes of this new experiment are length- sequences of outcomes from the original experiment (see Fig. ).

One example for such a perturbation is to add the of a to the of a . Fig. illustrates the above three routes to regularization. These routes are closely related and sometimes fully equivalent. using to perturb the in the of has the same effect as adding the penalty to the (which is nothing but ). The decision on which route to use for regularization can be based on the available computational infrastructure. For example, it might be much easier to implement than pruning.
