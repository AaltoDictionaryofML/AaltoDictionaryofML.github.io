	description={An \gls{ml} system\index{machine learning system (ML system)} 
		consists of computational \glspl{device} that can gather and store \gls{data}, 
		execute \glspl{algorithm}, and exchange information via communication networks. 
		Examples of the exchanged information include \gls{data} or updates of 
		\glspl{modelparam}. Conceptually, an \gls{ml} system is distinct from 
		an \gls{ml} \gls{algorithm}: an \gls{algorithm} specifies 
		the abstract computational procedure (e.g., an \gls{optmethod}), 
		while the system specifies how this procedure is realized in practice
		\cite{sipser2012computation,KnuthAlgoBook,tanenbaum2006modern}.
		Examples of \glspl{algorithm} executed by \glspl{device} within an \gls{mlsystem} include
		\glspl{gdmethod} for solving \gls{erm} problems.

{name={federated learning system (FL system)},
	description={A \gls{fl} system\index{federated learning system (FL system)} is a 
		distributed \gls{mlsystem} in which multiple computational \glspl{device} 
		collaborate to train \gls{ml} models without sharing their raw local \gls{data}.
		An \gls{fl} system is characterized by a communication network that specifies 
		which \glspl{device} can exchange information. Conceptually, an \gls{fl} system is 
		distinct from an \gls{fl} \gls{algorithm} \cite{DistributedSystems}. The system 
		specifies the participating entities, their interconnections, and execution constraints, while the \gls{algorithm} 
		specifies the update rules for local and global \glspl{modelparam} \cite{KnuthAlgoBook,LynchDistributedAlgorithms}.
		Typical information exchanged in an \gls{fl} system includes 
		\glspl{modelparam} or \gls{gradient} information, but not raw \gls{data}.
		See also: \gls{fl}, \gls{mlsystem}, \gls{flnetwork}, \gls{algorithm}.},
