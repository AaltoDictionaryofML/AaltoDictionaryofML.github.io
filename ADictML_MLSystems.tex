	description={An\index{automaton} automaton is a mathematical representation of a computing \gls{device} 
		whose behavior is described by a set of internal \glspl{state}, a memory 
		structure, and a \gls{state}-transition rule. Formally, an automaton consists 
		of a \gls{statespace}, a set of admissible memory configurations, 
		and a transition \gls{function} that specifies how the current \gls{state} 
		and memory are updated in response to inputs \cite{Sipser2013}. 
		The notion of an automaton is useful for the analysis of \glspl{algorithm}, such 
		as those used in \gls{ml} methods \cite{Cormen:2022aa}. 
		Collections of interacting automata can be used to study \glspl{distributedalgorithm}, 
		where each automaton represents a \gls{device} that executes local computations and 
		communicates with other \glspl{device} \cite{ParallelDistrBook}, \cite{LynchDistributedAlgorithms}.
